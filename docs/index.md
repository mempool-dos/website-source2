We will build a security monitor to expose attack instances.<br/>
Here is the bar chart of the empty blocks on Ethererum. We analyzed [[Etherscan Blocks](https://etherscan.io/blocks)]<br/>
And found in lasted 10000 blocks, there are 67 almost empty blocks whose gas used is less than 0.1%. <br/>
In particular, the occurrence of two consecutive empty blocks also occurred once.<br/>
